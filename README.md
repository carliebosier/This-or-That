# This or That

This or That is a social polling application where users create simple two-option polls and engage with the community through voting and commenting. The goal is to provide a fast, lightweight, and fun way for people to request opinions and instantly see community preferences.

## **🔍 Project Description**

This or That allows users to:

- Create polls with two options (each with text and optional images)
- Vote once per poll (enforced server-side for fairness)
- Comment on polls
- Browse polls by popularity, recency, or tags
- Participate as authenticated users or guests (with anti-spam restrictions)

The system is built with a React + Vite client and a backend API that handles poll creation, validation, voting, feeds, and database operations. Server-side checks ensure all rules—such as one-vote-per-poll—are enforced securely and accurately.

## **Core Features**
