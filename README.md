# This or That

This or That is a social polling application where users create simple two-option polls and engage with the community through voting and commenting. The goal is to provide a fast, lightweight, and fun way for people to request opinions and instantly see community preferences.

## **🔍 Project Description**

This or That allows users to:

- Create polls with two options (each with text and optional images)
- Vote once per poll (enforced server-side for fairness)
- Comment on polls
- Browse polls by popularity, recency, or tags
- Participate as authenticated users or guests (with anti-spam restrictions)

The system is built with a React + Vite client and a backend API that handles poll creation, validation, voting, feeds, and database operations. Server-side checks ensure all rules—such as one-vote-per-poll—are enforced securely and accurately.

## **Core Features**

- 🗳️ Two-option polls
- 👤 Authenticated + guest participation
- 🖼️ Optional images with accessibility requirements
- 🏷️ Tagging + searchable feeds
- 🔐 Secure authentication and rate limiting
- ⚡ Cached vote/comment counts for fast feed loading
- 🧭 Feeds sorted by popularity, recency, or tag

## **Future Enhancements**

- Poll expiration
- Personalized recommendations
- Private/group polls
- User analytics
- Real-time updates
